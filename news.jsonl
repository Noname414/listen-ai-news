However, current\nstate-of-the-art T2A models still struggle to satisfy human preferences for\nprompt-following and acoustic quality when generating complex multi-event\naudio. To improve the performance of the model in these high-level\napplications, we propose to enhance the basic capabilities of the model with AI\nfeedback learning. First, we introduce fine-grained AI audio scoring pipelines\nto: 1) verify whether each event in the text prompt is present in the audio\n(Event Occurrence Score), 2) detect deviations in event sequences from the\nlanguage description (Event Sequence Score), and 3) assess the overall acoustic\nand harmonic quality of the generated audio (Acoustic&Harmonic Quality). We\nevaluate these three automatic scoring pipelines and find that they correlate\nsignificantly better with human preferences than other evaluation metrics. This\nhighlights their value as both feedback signals and evaluation metrics.\nUtilizing our robust scoring pipelines, we construct a large audio preference\ndataset, T2A-FeedBack, which contains 41k prompts and 249k audios, each\naccompanied by detailed scores. Moreover, we introduce T2A-EpicBench, a\nbenchmark that focuses on long captions, multi-events, and story-telling\nscenarios, aiming to evaluate the advanced capabilities of T2A models.

By integrating the text prompt and\ncritical features, the receiver reconstructs high-fidelity images using a\ndiffusion-based generative model. Next, we propose the generative visual\ninformation fidelity (GVIF) metric to evaluate the visual quality of the\ngenerated image. By characterizing the statistical models of image features,\nthe GVIF metric quantifies the mutual information between the distorted\nfeatures and their original counterparts. By maximizing the GVIF metric, we\ndesign a channel-adaptive Gen-SemCom system that adaptively control the volume\nof features and compression rate according to the channel state. Experimental\nresults validate the GVIF metric's sensitivity to visual fidelity, correlating\nwith both the PSNR and critical information volume. In addition, the optimized\nsystem achieves superior performance over benchmarking schemes in terms of\nhigher PSNR and lower FID scores.", "authors": ["Jianhao Huang", "Qunsong Zeng", "Kaibin Huang"], "published_date": "2025-05-15", "title_zh": "具有關鍵資訊嵌入的生成式語義通訊視覺保真度指標", "summary_zh": "研究提出一種混合生成式語義通訊系統，透過嵌入關鍵資訊框架，同時傳輸文字提示和語義上重要的圖像特徵，以解決純粹提示驅動的生成導致細節丟失的問題。為評估系統性能，提出生成式視覺資訊保真度（GVIF）指標，以量化失真特徵與原始特徵之間的互信息。實驗結果驗證了GVIF指標對視覺保真度的敏感性，並設計了一種基於GVIF最大化的通道自適應系統，能夠根據通道狀態調整特徵數量和壓縮率，進而提升重建圖像的品質。", "audio": "audios/2505.10405v1.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-05-18T17:14:39.044337"}

While equilibria in the\none-round voting mechanisms lead to a good decision, they are usually hard to\ncompute and follow. We consider the two-round voting mechanism where the first\nround serves as a polling stage and the winning alternative only depends on the\noutcome of the second round. We show that the two-round voting mechanism is a\npowerful tool for making collective decisions. Firstly, every (approximated)\nequilibrium in the two-round voting mechanisms (asymptotically) leads to the\ndecision preferred by the majority as if the state of the world were revealed\nto the voters. Moreover, there exist natural equilibria in the two-round game\nfollowing intuitive behaviors such as informative voting, sincere voting\n[Austen-Smith and Banks, 1996], and the surprisingly popular strategy [Prelec\net al., 2017]. This sharply contrasts with the one-round voting mechanisms in\nthe previous literature, where no simple equilibrium is known. Finally, we show\nthat every equilibrium in the standard one-round majority vote mechanism gives\nan equilibrium in the two-round mechanisms that is not more complicated than\nthe one-round equilibrium. Therefore, the two-round voting mechanism provides a\nnatural equilibrium in every instance, including those where one-round voting\nfails to have a natural solution, and it can reach an informed majority\ndecision whenever one-round voting can.

Diffusion-based language\nmodels have emerged as a compelling alternative due to their powerful parallel\ngeneration capabilities and inherent editability. However, these models are\noften constrained by fixed-length generation. A promising direction is to\ncombine the strengths of both paradigms, segmenting sequences into blocks,\nmodeling autoregressive dependencies across blocks while leveraging discrete\ndiffusion to estimate the conditional distribution within each block given the\npreceding context. Nevertheless, their practical application is often hindered\nby two key limitations: rigid fixed-length outputs and a lack of flexible\ncontrol mechanisms. In this work, we address the critical limitations of fixed\ngranularity and weak controllability in current large diffusion language\nmodels. We propose CtrlDiff, a dynamic and controllable semi-autoregressive\nframework that adaptively determines the size of each generation block based on\nlocal semantics using reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we introduce a\nclassifier-guided control mechanism tailored to discrete diffusion, which\nsignificantly reduces computational overhead while facilitating efficient\npost-hoc conditioning without retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat CtrlDiff sets a new standard among hybrid diffusion models, narrows the\nperformance gap to state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches, and enables\neffective conditional text generation across diverse tasks.", "authors": ["Chihan Huang", "Hao Tang"], "published_date": "2025-05-20", "title_zh": "CtrlDiff：透過動態區塊預測與可控生成提升大型擴散語言模型", "summary_zh": "現今，擴散語言模型因其強大的平行生成能力和可編輯性而備受關注。然而，這些模型常受限於固定長度的生成。CtrlDiff提出一種動態且可控的半自迴歸框架，能基於局部語義自適應地決定每個生成區塊的大小。此外，我們還引入了一種針對離散擴散的分類器引導控制機制，在無需重新訓練的情況下，實現高效的後驗條件生成。實驗表明，CtrlDiff在混合擴散模型中樹立了新的標竿，縮小了與最先進自迴歸方法的性能差距，並能跨多種任務實現有效的條件文本生成。", "audio": "audios/2505.14455v1.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-05-21T09:20:47.242642"}

Several new programming frameworks have\nenabled developers to build these applications by composing them out of\nsemantic operators: a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with\nnatural language specifications. These include LLM-powered maps, filters,\njoins, etc. used for document processing tasks such as information extraction,\nsummarization, and more. While systems of semantic operators have achieved\nstrong performance on benchmarks, they can be difficult to optimize. An\noptimizer for this setting must determine how to physically implement each\nsemantic operator in a way that optimizes the system globally. Existing\noptimizers are limited in the number of optimizations they can apply, and most\n(if not all) cannot optimize system quality, cost, or latency subject to\nconstraint(s) on the other dimensions. In this paper we present Abacus, an\nextensible, cost-based optimizer which searches for the best implementation of\na semantic operator system given a (possibly constrained) optimization\nobjective. Abacus estimates operator performance by leveraging a minimal set of\nvalidation examples and, if available, prior beliefs about operator\nperformance. We evaluate Abacus on document processing workloads in the\nbiomedical and legal domains (BioDEX; CUAD) and multi-modal question answering\n(MMQA). We demonstrate that systems optimized by Abacus achieve 18.7%-39.2%\nbetter quality and up to 23.6x lower cost and 4.2x lower latency than the next\nbest system.", "authors": ["Matthew Russo", "Sivaprasad Sudhir", "Gerardo Vitagliano", "Chunwei Liu", "Tim Kraska", "Samuel Madden", "Michael Cafarella"], "published_date": "2025-05-20", "title_zh": "算盤 (Abacus): 一個基於成本的語義運算子系統最佳化器", "summary_zh": "大型語言模型催生了新的非結構化文件處理應用。開發者可以使用語義運算子，也就是基於AI、具自然語言規範的資料轉換，來建構這些應用。然而，優化這些運算子系統非常困難。現有的優化器能力有限，且難以同時優化品質、成本和延遲。本文提出 Abacus，一個可擴展、基於成本的優化器，能根據給定的優化目標（可能帶有約束）尋找語義運算子系統的最佳實現方案。Abacus 利用少量的驗證樣本和運算子效能的先驗知識來估算運算子效能。在生物醫學、法律領域和多模態問答工作負載上的評估表明，由 Abacus 優化的系統比其他系統能達到18.7%-39.2%的品質提升，並降低高達23.6倍的成本和4.2倍的延遲。", "audio": "audios/2505.14661v1.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-05-21T11:15:44.284777"}

Pre-trained neural\nnetworks that jointly model column names and table entries have recently\nboosted prediction accuracy. While these models outline the promises of world\nknowledge to interpret table values, they lack the convenience of popular\nfoundation models in text or vision. Indeed, they must be fine-tuned to bring\nbenefits, come with sizeable computation costs, and cannot easily be reused or\ncombined with other architectures. Here we introduce TARTE, a foundation model\nthat transforms tables to knowledge-enhanced vector representations using the\nstring to capture semantics.
