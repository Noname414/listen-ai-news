However, current\nstate-of-the-art T2A models still struggle to satisfy human preferences for\nprompt-following and acoustic quality when generating complex multi-event\naudio. To improve the performance of the model in these high-level\napplications, we propose to enhance the basic capabilities of the model with AI\nfeedback learning. First, we introduce fine-grained AI audio scoring pipelines\nto: 1) verify whether each event in the text prompt is present in the audio\n(Event Occurrence Score), 2) detect deviations in event sequences from the\nlanguage description (Event Sequence Score), and 3) assess the overall acoustic\nand harmonic quality of the generated audio (Acoustic&Harmonic Quality). We\nevaluate these three automatic scoring pipelines and find that they correlate\nsignificantly better with human preferences than other evaluation metrics. This\nhighlights their value as both feedback signals and evaluation metrics.\nUtilizing our robust scoring pipelines, we construct a large audio preference\ndataset, T2A-FeedBack, which contains 41k prompts and 249k audios, each\naccompanied by detailed scores. Moreover, we introduce T2A-EpicBench, a\nbenchmark that focuses on long captions, multi-events, and story-telling\nscenarios, aiming to evaluate the advanced capabilities of T2A models.

By integrating the text prompt and\ncritical features, the receiver reconstructs high-fidelity images using a\ndiffusion-based generative model. Next, we propose the generative visual\ninformation fidelity (GVIF) metric to evaluate the visual quality of the\ngenerated image. By characterizing the statistical models of image features,\nthe GVIF metric quantifies the mutual information between the distorted\nfeatures and their original counterparts. By maximizing the GVIF metric, we\ndesign a channel-adaptive Gen-SemCom system that adaptively control the volume\nof features and compression rate according to the channel state. Experimental\nresults validate the GVIF metric's sensitivity to visual fidelity, correlating\nwith both the PSNR and critical information volume. In addition, the optimized\nsystem achieves superior performance over benchmarking schemes in terms of\nhigher PSNR and lower FID scores.", "authors": ["Jianhao Huang", "Qunsong Zeng", "Kaibin Huang"], "published_date": "2025-05-15", "title_zh": "具有關鍵資訊嵌入的生成式語義通訊視覺保真度指標", "summary_zh": "研究提出一種混合生成式語義通訊系統，透過嵌入關鍵資訊框架，同時傳輸文字提示和語義上重要的圖像特徵，以解決純粹提示驅動的生成導致細節丟失的問題。為評估系統性能，提出生成式視覺資訊保真度（GVIF）指標，以量化失真特徵與原始特徵之間的互信息。實驗結果驗證了GVIF指標對視覺保真度的敏感性，並設計了一種基於GVIF最大化的通道自適應系統，能夠根據通道狀態調整特徵數量和壓縮率，進而提升重建圖像的品質。", "audio": "audios/2505.10405v1.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-05-18T17:14:39.044337"}

While equilibria in the\none-round voting mechanisms lead to a good decision, they are usually hard to\ncompute and follow. We consider the two-round voting mechanism where the first\nround serves as a polling stage and the winning alternative only depends on the\noutcome of the second round. We show that the two-round voting mechanism is a\npowerful tool for making collective decisions. Firstly, every (approximated)\nequilibrium in the two-round voting mechanisms (asymptotically) leads to the\ndecision preferred by the majority as if the state of the world were revealed\nto the voters. Moreover, there exist natural equilibria in the two-round game\nfollowing intuitive behaviors such as informative voting, sincere voting\n[Austen-Smith and Banks, 1996], and the surprisingly popular strategy [Prelec\net al., 2017]. This sharply contrasts with the one-round voting mechanisms in\nthe previous literature, where no simple equilibrium is known. Finally, we show\nthat every equilibrium in the standard one-round majority vote mechanism gives\nan equilibrium in the two-round mechanisms that is not more complicated than\nthe one-round equilibrium. Therefore, the two-round voting mechanism provides a\nnatural equilibrium in every instance, including those where one-round voting\nfails to have a natural solution, and it can reach an informed majority\ndecision whenever one-round voting can.

Diffusion-based language\nmodels have emerged as a compelling alternative due to their powerful parallel\ngeneration capabilities and inherent editability. However, these models are\noften constrained by fixed-length generation. A promising direction is to\ncombine the strengths of both paradigms, segmenting sequences into blocks,\nmodeling autoregressive dependencies across blocks while leveraging discrete\ndiffusion to estimate the conditional distribution within each block given the\npreceding context. Nevertheless, their practical application is often hindered\nby two key limitations: rigid fixed-length outputs and a lack of flexible\ncontrol mechanisms. In this work, we address the critical limitations of fixed\ngranularity and weak controllability in current large diffusion language\nmodels. We propose CtrlDiff, a dynamic and controllable semi-autoregressive\nframework that adaptively determines the size of each generation block based on\nlocal semantics using reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we introduce a\nclassifier-guided control mechanism tailored to discrete diffusion, which\nsignificantly reduces computational overhead while facilitating efficient\npost-hoc conditioning without retraining.

Fusing\nmonocular priors has been proven helpful for ill-posed matching, but the biased\nmonocular prior learned from small stereo datasets constrains the\ngeneralization. Recently, stereo matching has progressed by leveraging the\nunbiased monocular prior from the vision foundation model (VFM) to improve the\ngeneralization in ill-posed regions. We dive into the fusion process and\nobserve three main problems limiting the fusion of the VFM monocular prior. The\nfirst problem is the misalignment between affine-invariant relative monocular\ndepth and absolute depth of disparity. Besides, when we use the monocular\nfeature in an iterative update structure, the over-confidence in the disparity\nupdate leads to local optima results. A direct fusion of a monocular depth map\ncould alleviate the local optima problem, but noisy disparity results computed\nat the first several iterations will misguide the fusion. In this paper, we\npropose a binary local ordering map to guide the fusion, which converts the\ndepth map into a binary relative format, unifying the relative and absolute\ndepth representation. The computed local ordering map is also used to re-weight\nthe initial disparity update, resolving the local optima and noisy problem. In\naddition, we formulate the final direct fusion of monocular depth to the\ndisparity as a registration problem, where a pixel-wise linear regression\nmodule can globally and adaptively align them.

To address these questions, we\npropose the Instance Core Segmentation Dataset (InsCore), a synthetic\npre-training dataset based on formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL).\nInsCore generates fully annotated instance segmentation images that reflect key\ncharacteristics of industrial data, including complex occlusions, dense\nhierarchical masks, and diverse non-rigid shapes, distinct from typical web\nimagery. Unlike previous methods, InsCore requires neither real images nor\nhuman annotations. Experiments on five industrial datasets show that models\npre-trained with InsCore outperform those trained on COCO and ImageNet-21k, as\nwell as fine-tuned SAM, achieving an average improvement of 6.2 points in\ninstance segmentation performance. This result is achieved using only 100k\nsynthetic images, more than 100 times fewer than the 11 million images in SAM's\nSA-1B dataset, demonstrating the data efficiency of our approach. These\nfindings position InsCore as a practical and license-free vision foundation\nmodel for industrial applications.", "authors": ["Shinichi Mae", "Ryousuke Yamada", "Hirokatsu Kataoka"], "published_date": "2025-05-19", "title_zh": "工業合成分割預訓練", "summary_zh": "現有的圖像分割模型在工業應用中面臨授權限制和領域差異的挑戰。本研究提出一個基於公式驅動的合成數據集InsCore，無需真實圖像或人工標注，即可預訓練出專為工業應用設計的圖像分割模型。實驗證明，用InsCore預訓練的模型在多個工業數據集上的表現，優於用COCO和ImageNet預訓練的模型，甚至超越了微調後的SAM模型，且只需少量合成數據就能達到很好的效果。InsCore為工業應用提供了一個實用且無授權問題的視覺基礎模型。", "audio": "audios/2505.13099v2.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-05-21T23:17:30.656713"}

While recent\nAI progress has been driven by the training of large general-purpose foundation\nmodels, the creation of smaller models specialized for narrow domains could be\nvaluable for both efficiency and safety. In this work, we explore two\nchallenges involved in creating such systems, having to do with basic\nproperties of how neural networks learn and structure their representations.\nThe first challenge regards when it is possible to train narrow models from\nscratch. Through experiments on a synthetic task, we find that it is sometimes\nnecessary to train networks on a wide distribution of data to learn certain\nnarrow skills within that distribution. This effect arises when skills depend\non each other hierarchically, and training on a broad distribution introduces a\ncurriculum which substantially accelerates learning. The second challenge\nregards how to transfer particular skills from large general models into small\nspecialized models.

This\narchitecture ensures seamless integration and processing across different data\ntypes. (ii) We implement a mixed long chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning\nstrategy that curates a unified CoT format across modalities.

To achieve\naccurate semantic matching between regions, we leverage the self-attention\nmodule of a pre-trained diffusion model, which is trained on a large dataset\nand exhibits powerful attention capabilities. To harness this power, we propose\na novel, fine-tuning-free approach based on a pre-trained diffusion model,\nmaking two key contributions. First, we introduce dual attention-guided color\ntransfer. We utilize the self-attention module to compute an attention map\nbetween the input and reference images, effectively capturing semantic\ncorrespondences. The color features from the reference image is then\ntransferred to the semantically matching regions of the input image, guided by\nthis attention map, and finally, the grayscale features are replaced with the\ncorresponding color features. Notably, we utilize dual attention to calculate\nattention maps separately for the grayscale and color images, achieving more\nprecise semantic alignment. Second, we propose classifier-free colorization\nguidance, which enhances the transferred colors by combining color-transferred\nand non-color-transferred outputs.
